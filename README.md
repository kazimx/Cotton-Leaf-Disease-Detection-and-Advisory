üå± Cotton Leaf Disease Detection & Advisory System
This project is an AI-powered decision support system for cotton farmers.
It detects cotton leaf diseases using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model, calculates disease severity, and generates actionable advisories with LLM integration (GPT-4o-mini).

It also integrates real-time weather data to give context-aware recommendations (e.g., avoiding spraying before rain). A Streamlit interface provides an easy-to-use interactive UI for farmers to upload images, visualize results, and chat with the advisory assistant.
